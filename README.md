## Contribution Guidelines

We welcome contributions from the community! Whether you're fixing bugs, implementing features, or improving documentation, your help is greatly appreciated. Follow these steps and guidelines to contribute effectively:

### Prerequisites
1. **Node Package Manager**: We recommend using **pnpm** over npm for managing dependencies, as it ensures better performance and workspace handling.
   - Install pnpm globally if you haven't already:
     ```bash
     npm install -g pnpm
     ```
2. **Code Formatting and Linting**:
   We use **Biome.js** as the linter and formatter for the project.
   - Install the **Biome.js** VSCode extension for consistent linting and formatting in your editor.
   - Ensure that your code is formatted and linted before submitting a pull request (PR).

3. **Tech Stack**:
   - The project is built with **Electron**, **Vite**, and **SolidJS** for a modern, fast development workflow.
